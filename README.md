# [Bad Passwords for your system   ](http://github.com/skyzyx/bad-passwords)

A list of the top 10,000 most-used passwords from hacked password lists.

Mutated list was generated by installing [John the Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john/) and running:

```bash
john --wordlist=raw.txt --rules --stdout > raw-mutated.txt
```

This produces a list which starts with the top 10,000 and makes commonplace alterations to that list. This increases the size of the list from 10,000 → over 422,000.
